Interpreter in C / C++
Compiler that compiles LoLi code into LLVM IR
Combine the whole thing
Cheers

Misc:
Visual-LoLi (DSL for making text editor in LoLi)
LoLi-Web (Web framework in LoLi) (Need a better name)
LoLi-ASM (Assembler in LoLi) (Need a better name)

Goal:
To make LoLi a real "full-stack" language including:
Meta-DSL
DSL
Using as script
Run with interpreter
Compile into binary
Lower-Level (ASM level)
(with great thanks to my friend Nenad, creator of the Red Language, for the idea of "full-stack language")
